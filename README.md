Side-scrolling action game

Initially made as a project for my Game Programming class at the University of Denver,
I hope to expand this into a larger scale project when I have the time. I do not claim to
own any of the character's likenesses, rather they are fanmade interpretations of IP's held
by Nintendo and Intelligent Systems.
