 Side-scrolling action game


This is a WIP game that I first made in my Game Programming I class at the University of Denver.
I hope to expand this more and make it a more complete action game that takes inspiration from
the Fire Emblem franchise that is owned by Nintendo. I am not affiliated with Nintendo or Intelligent
Systems, the developers of Fire Emblem.
